<h6>Build with the inspiration of oriental flare from Distant Dynasties. 
150+ New oriental themed build pieces from leaning towards the same era as the vikings themselves.  
Honor the formidable warriors of the east with your building skills!   <p>  
   
All pieces are found in a dedicated "hammer", *Ancient Scroll*.  

*item_AncientScroll* takes 1 FineWood to craft. 
Recipe for hammer can be locked/adjusted via SERVER SYNC/config.  


NOTE: This is semi-WIP, build pieces like Rooves are a little funky due to their complex nature.  

Peices are divided across all sections/tabs of the "hammer" for better visability.
  
</h6>


<br>


>**Distant Dynasties** only requires **BEPINEX** as a dependency. 
 Don't like the recipes? Use a custom recipe editor, like [Wacky's Database](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/WackyMole/WackysDatabase/).
  
<p>

Install by unzipping package and dropping *DistantDynasties.dll* into your client side and/or server **plugins** folder.
*TheBeesDecree.DistantDynasties.cfg* will generate upon running game/restarting server.
