Will not function pre-mistlands verions of game.   

 
  <h6> 
  
Build with the inspiration of oriental flare from Distant Dynasties. 
125+ New oreintal themed build pieces from leaning towards the same era as the vikings themselves.  
Honor the formitable warriors of the east with your building skills!   
   


All pieces are found in a dedicated "hammer", *Ancient Scroll*.  

*item_AncientScroll* takes 1 FineWood to craft. 
Recipe for hammer can be locked/adjusted via SERVER SYNC/config.  


NOTE: This is semi-WIP, build pieces like Rooves are a little funky due to their complex nature.  

Peices are divided across all sections/tabs of the "hammer" for better visability.

>**DIstant Dynasties** only requires **BEPINEX** as a dependency.
