# READ!!! THIS MOD NOW HAS A DEPENDANCY ON JOTUNN (JVL). SINCE THE CHANGE PLEASE BACK UP YOUR WORLD FIRST JUST TO BE SAFE!!!  
<br>
 
<h6>Build with the inspiration of oriental flare from Distant Dynasties. 
150+ New oriental themed build pieces from leaning towards the same era as the vikings themselves.  
Honor the formidable warriors of the east with your building skills!   <p>  
   
All pieces are found in a dedicated "hammer", *Ancient Scroll*.  

*item_AncientScroll* takes 1 FineWood to craft. 
 


NOTE: This is semi-WIP, build pieces like Rooves are a little funky due to their complex nature.  

Peices are divided across all sections/tabs of the "hammer" for better visability.
